# AZMAP Generator
**AZMAP Generator** is a small tool that **extracts data from KML files** which are exported from **Google Maps** and adds extra info such as **the name, description, rooms, and images** of all the locations and **exports them all in a single JSON file (with extension .azmap)**. This JSON file can then be imported into other applications to display the data on the map.
