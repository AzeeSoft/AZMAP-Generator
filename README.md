# AZMAP Generator
**AZMAP Generator** is a small tool that **extracts data from KML files** which are exported from **Google Maps** and adds extra info such as **the name, description, rooms, and images** of all the locations and **exports them all in a single JSON file (with extension .azmap)**. This JSON file can then be imported into other applications to display the data on the map.

- I developed this tool using **JavaFX** in **2017** while working on the Honors College App for the University.
- While working on that app, I needed the map data to **include custom data** such as **building description, room info, and custom images**. And hence, I ended up writing this tool to **embed additional data to the KML data exported from Google Maps**.
    - **Languages Used:** Java, CSS
    - **Platforms/Libraries:** JavaFX, Google Maps, Git
